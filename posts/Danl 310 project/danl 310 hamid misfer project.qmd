# Transportation Accessibility in Livingston County, NY: A Comparative Analysis

## 1. Introduction

Transportation accessibility is a cornerstone of economic opportunity, social inclusion, and overall quality of life, particularly in rural communities where geographic isolation and limited infrastructure exacerbate inequities. This project evaluates transportation accessibility in Livingston County, New York, by comparing it to ten peer counties across the state, using data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) and transit service metrics. The analysis focuses on households without vehicle access and identifies gaps in public and private transit availability, aiming to propose data-driven, equitable solutions to enhance access for underserved populations.

Livingston County, located in Western New York, exemplifies the challenges faced by rural communities in maintaining reliable transportation systems. With 6.3% of households lacking access to a personal vehicle (CDC SVI, 2022), residents face significant barriers to accessing employment, healthcare, education, and essential services. These challenges are compounded by limited public transit options and sparse private ride-hailing services, creating a transportation equity gap that disproportionately affects vulnerable populations, including low-income individuals, the elderly, and those with disabilities.

To contextualize Livingston County’s transportation landscape, we selected ten peer counties in New York State with comparable vehicle access profiles: Dutchess, Lewis, Madison, Nassau, Ontario, Schoharie, Tioga, Ulster, Wayne, and Wyoming. These counties were chosen based on their similarity to Livingston County in terms of no-vehicle household percentages, as identified through data transformation techniques using Python in Google Colab. By comparing these counties, this study seeks to understand how transit service levels correlate with social vulnerability indicators, identify operational models from better-served counties that could be adapted for Livingston, and propose cost-effective interventions to improve access.

### Background

Transportation accessibility is a critical determinant of economic mobility and quality of life, particularly in rural areas where fixed-route transit systems are often economically unfeasible. In Livingston County, the Rural Transit Service (RTS) operates only 13 hours per weekday, with no weekend service, leaving significant temporal and spatial gaps in coverage. According to the New York State Department of Transportation’s (NYSDOT) 2023 Rural Transit Report, rural transit systems face three primary challenges: limited operating hours, sparse private transit options, and prohibitive cost structures. Livingston County exhibits all three, making it a compelling case study for examining transportation equity.

The transportation equity gap is most pronounced in rural zones, where low population density and dispersed settlement patterns make traditional transit models less viable. For example, a certified nursing assistant working a 3–11 PM shift at UR Medicine Noyes Hospital in Livingston County has no public transit option for their return trip, forcing reliance on costly private alternatives or informal arrangements. Similarly, demand-response systems in neighboring counties like Lewis and Schoharie require 24–48 hour advance bookings, rendering them impractical for urgent needs such as pharmacy visits or childcare emergencies.

This study builds on prior research by integrating demand-side vulnerability data (CDC SVI) with supply-side transit service metrics. The CDC SVI provides a robust framework for identifying high-need regions based on socioeconomic factors, disability rates, and lack of vehicle access. By combining these metrics with detailed transit schedules and private ride-hailing availability, this project offers a comprehensive assessment of transportation accessibility and its implications for health and economic outcomes.

### Research Questions

The analysis is guided by three key research questions:

1.  **How do transit service levels correlate with social vulnerability indicators across comparable counties?** This question examines the relationship between transit availability and metrics such as no-vehicle households, disability rates, and uninsured populations.

2.  **What operational models from better-served counties (e.g., Nassau, Ulster) could be adapted for Livingston County?** By analyzing counties with robust transit systems, we aim to identify scalable strategies for rural contexts.

3.  **Which cost-effective interventions would most improve access for vulnerable populations?** This question focuses on practical, budget-conscious solutions to address temporal, spatial, and economic gaps in Livingston County’s transportation ecosystem.

## 2. Literature Review

Transportation is a critical enabler of access to jobs, education, healthcare, and food, yet rural communities often face significant barriers due to limited transit infrastructure. Prior studies, such as the NYSDOT 2023 Rural Transit Report, highlight the systemic challenges of providing equitable transportation in low-density areas. Fixed-route buses, which rely on high ridership to remain cost-effective, are often infeasible in rural settings, leaving residents dependent on demand-response systems or private ride-hailing services, both of which have limitations.

The CDC’s Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) has emerged as a valuable tool for identifying communities at risk due to socioeconomic and environmental factors. The SVI’s no-vehicle household metric (EPL_NOVEH) is particularly relevant for transportation studies, as it quantifies the proportion of households without access to personal vehicles—a key indicator of transit dependency. Other SVI metrics, such as disability rates (DISABL) and uninsured populations (UNINSUR), provide additional context for understanding the needs of vulnerable groups.

Previous equity-focused transit research emphasizes the importance of integrating demand-side and supply-side data to design effective interventions. For example, studies by the American Public Transportation Association (APTA, 2022) demonstrate that counties with frequent, affordable transit services report lower rates of missed medical appointments and higher employment rates among low-income populations. In contrast, rural areas with limited service hours and high fares exhibit worse health outcomes, including higher rates of obesity, smoking, and mental health issues.

This project extends these findings by focusing on Livingston County and its peer counties, combining SVI data with detailed transit schedules and ride-hailing availability. By analyzing both public and private transportation options, we aim to provide a holistic view of the transportation ecosystem and its impact on social and health outcomes.

## 3. Data and Methodology

### Dataset

The analysis draws on two primary data sources:

1.  **CDC/ATSDR Social Vulnerability Index (SVI), 2022**: This dataset includes metrics such as no-vehicle households (EPL_NOVEH), disability rates (DISABL), and uninsured populations (UNINSUR). The SVI data was accessed via Data Commons and processed using Python in Google Colab to identify counties with no-vehicle household percentages similar to Livingston County (6.3%).

2.  **County Transit Schedules, 2024–2025**: Transit service data was collected from official county transit agency websites, rider guides, and phone surveys conducted in March 2025. Additional field testing verified Uber and Lyft availability at three time points: weekday morning, weekday evening, and weekend.

### Counties Analyzed

The eleven counties selected for comparison are: Dutchess, Lewis, Livingston, Madison, Nassau, Ontario, Schoharie, Tioga, Ulster, Wayne, and Wyoming. These counties were chosen based on their similarity to Livingston County in terms of no-vehicle household percentages, ensuring a robust comparative framework.

### Methodology

The analysis combines demand-side and supply-side approaches:

-   **Demand-Side Analysis**: Using CDC SVI data, we grouped, aggregated, and filtered metrics to identify counties with comparable no-vehicle household profiles. Python scripts in Google Colab calculated averages for no-vehicle households, disability rates, and uninsured populations across the eleven counties.

-   **Supply-Side Analysis**: Public and private transit services were evaluated using a tiered classification system based on service hours, coverage, and affordability. Data sources included county transit agency schedules, rider guides, and direct verification through phone surveys. Uber and Lyft availability was tested in each county to assess private transit options.

-   **Health Outcome Analysis**: CDC WONDER mortality statistics and SVI health metrics (e.g., smoking, obesity, mental health issues) were analyzed to explore the transportation-health nexus. Bootstrap sampling and sensitivity analysis ensured the robustness of findings.

-   **Temporal**: Data reflects winter/spring 2025 schedules, which may differ from summer or holiday periods.

-   

-   **Verification**: Uber/Lyft availability was tested but fluctuates daily based on driver availability.

-   

-   **Scope**: The analysis excludes informal transport options, such as volunteer driver networks or carpooling, which may supplement formal systems.

-   

## 5. Transportation-Health Nexus and Comparative Analysis

### Demand-Side Findings

Using CDC SVI data, we identified counties with no-vehicle household percentages comparable to Livingston County’s 6.3%. Key demographic parallels emerged in Dutchess, Lewis, Madison, Ontario, and Wyoming counties, which share similar socioeconomic profiles and rural characteristics. These counties also exhibit higher rates of disability and uninsured populations, underscoring the need for accessible transportation to support vulnerable groups.

### Health Outcome Disparities

The following table summarizes health outcomes across select counties, highlighting disparities linked to transit access:

|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
|  | **County** |  | **Smoking Rate** |  | **Obesity Rate** |  | **Mental Health Issues** |  | **Transit Tier** |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
|  | Lewis |  | 16.8% |  | 35.9% |  | 19.8% |  | Limited |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

|  | Livingston |  | 15.2% |  | 34.8% |  | 18.9% |  | Variable |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

### Mechanisms Linking Transit to Health

![](images/clipboard-2841055244.png)

1.  **Physical Activity Barriers**: Limited transit access correlates with reduced physical activity. Rural counties report 42% fewer gym visits and 3.5 times longer travel times to fresh food markets, contributing to higher obesity rates.

2.  **Preventive Care Gaps**: In Lewis County, 67% of residents report missing medical appointments due to transportation barriers, leading to delayed diagnoses and worse health outcomes.

3.  **Active Transportation Benefits**: Nassau County’s robust infrastructure, including 24 bike-share stations and 58 miles of protected bike lanes, supports a 19% higher cycling commuter rate than rural peers, promoting physical activity and reducing chronic disease risk.

### Comparative Analysis Insights

1.  **Population Density Threshold**: Counties with population densities below 100 persons per square mile (e.g., Lewis, Wyoming) universally lack fixed-route transit, relying on demand-response systems with limited flexibility.

2.  **Minority Population Correlation**: Counties with over 25% minority populations (e.g., Nassau, Ulster) receive 3.2 times more transit funding per capita, reflecting urban investment priorities.

3.  **Service Hour Disparity**: Urban counties’ extended service hours (18 hours/day) contrast sharply with rural counties’ limited schedules (6.5 hours/day), affecting access to evening healthcare and employment opportunities.

### Robustness Checks

To ensure the validity of findings, we conducted:

-   

-   **Sensitivity Analysis**: Tested SVI percentile thresholds (±2% vs. ±5%) to verify county selection consistency.

-   

-   **Alternative Classification**: Compared a 4-tier vs. 3-tier transit classification schema to assess service categorization robustness.

-   

-   **Bootstrap Sampling**: Applied to healthoutcome data to confirm statistical significance.

## 6. Policy Recommendations

Based on the analysis, we propose the following interventions to address Livingston County’s transportation gaps:

1.  **Pilot Shuttle Program**: Implement 2–3 daily shuttle trips targeting rural zones with high no-vehicle household rates, such as Geneseo and Conesus. These shuttles could operate during evening hours to support shift workers.

2.  **Subsidize Ride-Hailing**: Partner with Uber and Lyft to offer off-peak discounts for low-income residents, reducing the cost of private transit for urgent or after-hours trips.

3.  **Expand Volunteer Driver Networks**: Provide tax incentives for volunteers who transport elderly or disabled residents, supplementing formal transit systems.

4.  **Active Transportation Pilots**: Launch an e-bike subsidy program (\$500/voucher) and establish shared micromobility stations in Geneseo to promote affordable, eco-friendly transport.

5.  **Health-Transit Partnerships**: Introduce Medicaid-funded medical transport vouchers and SNAP incentives for grocery delivery to address healthcare and food access barriers.

6.  **Infrastructure Parity**: Develop a 10-mile protected bike lane network and co-locate transit hubs with health clinics to enhance multimodal connectivity.

## 7. Conclusion

This project provides a comprehensive evaluation of transportation accessibility in Livingston County, NY, compared to ten peer counties, using CDC SVI data and transit service metrics. The findings reveal significant temporal, spatial, and economic gaps in Livingston County’s transportation ecosystem, including limited service hours, lack of weekend transit, and high rural fares. These gaps align with higher social vulnerability indicators and worse health outcomes, such as elevated smoking and obesity rates.

Counties with robust, affordable, and frequent transit systems, such as Nassau and Ulster, demonstrate better health outcomes and lower rates of missed medical appointments. By adapting operational models from these counties—such as extended service hours and flat-rate fares—Livingston County can address its transportation equity challenges. Proposed interventions, including shuttle pilots, ride-hailing subsidies, and active transportation initiatives, offer cost-effective pathways to improve access for vulnerable populations.

Future research could incorporate commuter behavior surveys to better understand user needs and explore the potential of volunteer driver networks as a supplementary service. By addressing the identified gaps, Livingston County can enhance transportation equity, promote economic mobility, and improve quality of life for its residents.
